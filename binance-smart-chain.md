The _Binance Smart Chain_ (BSC) is an alternative blockchain created and maintained
by the Chinese cryptocurrency company Binance. It operates very similarly to
[Ethereum](ethereum.md) and this document assumes you have an understanding
of that system.

The native currency of BSC is the _Binance Coin_ (BNB). BNB is used similarly to
to ether on Ethereum and pays for transaction gas. 

BSC is an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatible network. It runs smart contracts
using the same language and basic rules of Ethereum. If you use wallet software such as
Metamask, you can even use the same address/keys on BSC as you do on Ethereum!

BSC uses proof-of-stake to build its blockchain instead of proof-of-work.

## Why use BSC?
At the time of writing (Feb. 2021) transactions on the Ethereum blockchain can cost
anywhere from $20 to $90+ worth of gas to execute simple, common smart contracts.
On BSC, execution of the same contract may only cost $0.20. On BSC, transactions clear in
seconds, not hours or days.

BSC offers very similiar (if not identical) applications to the Ethereum blockchain in the
defi market space. If you are looking to deposit $100 worth of stablecoins into an
interest-earning pool, your transactions fees will be signifigantly lower on BSC.

## Why to avoid BSC?
- BSC is proof-of-stake, not proof-of-work.
    - The rules about block creation and new BNB is completely different from Ethereum
- BSC is ultimately the product of a for-profit Chinese company who works on it regularly
    - While there is a level of decentralization to it, it is not as "trustless" as Ethereum or Bitcoin
- Many of the assets on BSC are representative of assets on other blockchains. While the market price may treat them similarly at this point in time, there is no technical guarantee they are equals.
- Binance is known to actively suppress users located in the United States
    - This is likely due more to Binance wanting to avoid regulators, not malice on their part

Any activities on BSC should be considered _highly risky_. Do your own research and don't take
more risk than you are willing to lose in the blink-of-an-eye.

## Wallet Configuration
Since BSC is an Ethereum-compatible chain, you can likely use tools you are already faimilar with.

If configuring Metamask as your wallet, you can enable BSC as a custom network in your settings. 
Open the network configuration and add a new "Custom Network". 

Use these settings
- Network Name: `Binance Smart Chain`
    - This name is a personal label, feel free to change it.
- RPC URL: `https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/`
- Chain ID: `0x38`
- Symbol: `BNB`
- Block Explorer URL: `https://bscscan.com`
