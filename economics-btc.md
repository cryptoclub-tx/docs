# Bitcoin Economics
Bitcoin is the _gold standard_ for cryptocurrencies. It's
universally accepted and desired. But what makes a bitcoin
valuable?

This document will delve into the multifaceted forces that
drive the Bitcoin economy.

## Fundamentals
1 bitcoin is a unit of measurement. It is made up of a smaller unit
called a "satoshi". 1 satoshi is _0.00000001 BTC_. So you could say
you have 0.0005 BTC or you could say you have 50,000 satoshi.

Bitcoin stores all its network data on a _blockchain_ secured by _proof-of-work_.
The Bitcoin blockchain was started on January 3rd 2009.

As of Februrary 2021, there are 18.6 million bitcoin in existence.
The Bitcoin protocol has a limit of 21 million bitcoin that can ever be mined.
At this time, 88.65% of all the bitcoin that will ever exist already does and is
up for grabs. The remaining 2.4 million bitcoin will be mined between now and
roughly the year 2140. The amount of bitcoin rewarded for each mined block will
half approximately every 4 years.

## Mining
(See the [mining](mining.md) doc for details)
To mine Bitcoin, you need to contribute to the hashpower of the network. Generally,
over time, your reward is porportional to the amount of hashpower that you contribute
to the network.

At any given point, miners can approximate (based on the difficulty) how many hashes
will be needed to guess before a valid one is found. The difficulty increases/decreases porportionately
to how much hashrate the network has.

If a miner will need about 1 billion hashes to find a valid one, their limits
include how many hashes they can make (based off their mining hardware) and
how much they will pay for the electricity to do so.

If you are paying high rates for electricity, mining will cost you. This is why
many mining operations actually happen _inside_ power plants. If you get electricity
for free, then mining is _always_ profitable (ignoring hardware costs). 

Mining is, fundamentally, the act of convering electricity into hashes, then hoping
the hashes are valid. The valid hashes need to cover the cost of generating all the bad ones.
Thus, if you have to spend $10k in electicity for 1 bitcoin, you are not likely to sell
bitcoin for less than $10k.

In addition to rewards for fidning a new block, miners also get transaction fees.
This incentivises miners to contribute their hashing power to the network with the most
users.

## Users/Security
Users of bitcoin are ultimately holding their portion of a 21-million-unit-whole. If you
own 1 bitcoin, then there can never be more than 20,999,999 people richer than you
(this is jokingly referred to as _The 21 Million Club_).

The value of this piece of a whole is that it is a stake of claim on a trustless, decentralized
permissionless ledger. This ledger is backed by more hashing power than any other
such network. The network has run longer than any other such network and has been done
in the open since day #1. 

Much how miners are incentivised to go to the users, users are incentivised to
go to the most hashpower, as it represents the security of the chain.
This security comes without requiring a centralize authoirty, which makes it
immune to traditional methods of censorship such as sanctions and blockades. 

As more users acquire bitcoin and HODL, the amount avaliable for purchase dwindles.
This tends to create panic or "FOMO" (fear-of-missing-out) among entities that
may not be able to purchase bitcoin in the future.

## Alternative Finance
There are many different cryptoassets in existence today, but some are not
directly tradable for others. Bitcoin has become the standard in cryptoasset liquidity.
Many projects now support forms of "locking up" bitcoin into their own systems, making
forms of bitcoin accesible in other platforms (e.g. Wrapped Bitcoin on Ethereum).

Even if there is no direct way to swap one thing for another, both can almost always be traded
for bitcoin. While other blockchains may offer different features and functionality, the
security and stability of Bitcoin itself is unmatched. In this way, Bitcoin has become
the reserve currency of the global cryptospace.
